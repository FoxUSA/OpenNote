# OpenNote

> This project has received the kiss of death. That is, I myself don't use it anymore. I have switched to using a [text editor with markdown support](https://vscodium.com/), Git, and [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) for my journaling/note taking.
> If you want to export your notes, the [cli](https://github.com/FoxUSA/OpenNote-CLI) can dump them to text files.
