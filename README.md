How To Install
--------------
- Create a MYSQL database named "OpenNote"
- Download and extract OpenNote into a folder on your php web-server called "OpenNote"
- Open up the sql folder and run "notebook.sql" in your OpenNote database
- Change the database connection settings inside of web-server path/OpenNote/modules/core/common.php to match your db settings.
These are stored in the following lines of code in /OpenNote/modules/core/common.php:
```php
			static $mysqlServer = "localhost";
			
			static $mysqlUser = "notebook";
			
			static $mysqlPass = "password";
			
			static $mysqlDB = "notebook";
```
			
- Run composer install on the command line to install the required dependencies

The web has many resources on how to install composer. In normal scenarios a simple:
```bash
			curl -S http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```
will do the trick. You can then use:
```bash
			./composer.phar install
```
to install required dependencies.

- Now the site install is complete. You can now open the site by going to your webserver url +/OpenNote
